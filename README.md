# hello-world

This marks my start into the GitHub and also hopefully into the coding world.
I have had some experience with something loosely connected to coding in High School where I took part in a programming/IT class, which was fun but really basic. 
So here I want to get to know the world of coding a little better, we'll see if it leads somewhere.
